            <h2>What is it truly about?</h2>
            <p class="headlineparagraph">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease 
                caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. 
                The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
                During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".
                the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus". 
                This nickname was due to many diseases being referred to by its geographical location
                 (Zika virus, Spanish Flu, etc.) in the past.
                 This name would cause potential social stigma against China and Asians in general,
                 thus in January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 
                 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease
                 as interim names per 2015 guidance and international guidelines 
                 against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names.
                 The official names <div class="highlight">COVID‑19</div> and <div class="highlight">SARS-CoV-2</div> were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with 
                 <div class="highlight">COVID-19</div> being shorthand for <div class="highlight">"coronavirus disease 2019".</div></p>

        <section id="medicalhead" class="section-display-2">
            <h1 class="headliner display-2">Medical data so far</h1>
            <h2>Medical data on COVID-19</h2>
            <p>
                COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 
                'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2).
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a <strong class="symptom">novel</strong> (not previously recorded)
                severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 
                It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia 
                connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
                All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle 
                occur in related coronaviruses in nature,
                particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus aka Chinese horseshoe bats.
                <br>
                Outside the human body, 
                the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble.
                <br>
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat, povidone-iodine, and ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation</div>
            are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces.
            <br>
            <p>
                SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
                It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. 
                Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. 
                It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
                <br>
                The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include 
                membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). 
                The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, 
                maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; 
                whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.
                <br>
                <br>
                The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.
                The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by 
                <a href="https://gisaid.org" target="_blank">GISAID</a>, <a href="https://nextstrain.org/" target="_blank">Nextstrain</a> and <a href="https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/" target="_blank">Pango</a>.
                <br>
                The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet,
                 for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, 
                 giving the justification that they 
                 "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences."
                 Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), 
                 while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).
                 The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.
                 Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020, 
                 for example Cluster 5 in Denmark which emerged among minks and mink farmers,
                 and after strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, 
                 the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of December 2021, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations:
                <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Alpha variant</strong> (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent,
                 <br> 
                 <strong class="symptom" >Beta variant</strong> (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), 
                 <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Gamma variant</strong> (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), 
                 <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Delta variant</strong> (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant),
                 <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Omicron variant</strong> (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.
                 <br>
                 On December 19, 2023, the WHO declared that another distinctive variant, 
                 JN.1, had emerged as a "variant of interest." 
                 Though the WHO expects an increase in cases globally, particularly for countries entering winter, 
                 the current overall global health risk (as of December 21, 2023) remains low.

            <h1 class="headliner display-2">Symptoms</h1>
            <h2>Symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
            <p>Covid-19 symptoms depend on the variant contracted and person infected, however the most common symptoms include</p>
            <div class="highlight symptom">coughing, fever, loss of smell (medical term: anosmia), and loss of taste (medical term: ageusia).</div>
            Less common symptoms include 
            <div class="symptom">headaches, nasal congestion & runny nose, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, 
            eye irritation, toes swelling / turning purple,</div>
            and in moderate to severe cases,
            <strong>breathing difficulties.</strong>
            People with the COVID-19 infection may have different symptoms, 
            and their symptoms may change over time. 
            <br>
            Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified:
            <br> 
            1) <div class="symptom">Respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum (commonly referred to as phlegm), 
            shortness of breath, and fever; </div>
            <br>
            2) <div class="symptom">A musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue;</div> 
            <br>
            3) <div class="symptom">A cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.</div>
            <br>
            <p>
                At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus <strong class="symptom">do not develop noticeable symptoms</strong> at any point in time.
                These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.
                 Other infected people will develop symptoms later (called "pre-symptomatic") 
                or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.
                As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. 
                The median (average) delay for COVID-19 is four to five days possibly being infected for 1-4 of those days.
                Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, 
                and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.
                <br>
                Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. 
                However, some people continue to experience a range of effects, 
                such as fatigue, for months, even after recovery.
                <br>
                This is the result of a condition called long COVID, 
                which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months at a time.
                Long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of COVID-19. 
                Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the disease.

            <h1 class="headliner display-2">Diagnosis</h1>
            <h2>Common diagnosis for COVID-19</h2>
            <p>
                COVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms 
                and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
                or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.
                long with laboratory testing, 
                chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                Viral testing
            </div>
            <p>
                The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests,
                which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.
                As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited."
                <strong class="highlight">
                    Commonly referred to as a swab test,
                </strong>
                the test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab (Swab for back of nose and throat); 
                however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
                Results are generally available within hours or minutes, with a common self-taken test from a test kit taking about 15-20 minutes.
                Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. 
                Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.
                The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed out that 
                "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine 
                or discharge from hospital are not infectious, 
                but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" 
                and have called for 
                "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing".
                In September 2020, 
                the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories 
                to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, 
                when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results".
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                Using a test kit
            </div>
            <p>
                A common way to self-diagose COVID-19 without going to a clinic or hospital is to use a self-test kit.

                Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 
                in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection 
                but are not recommended for routine screening.
                Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities
