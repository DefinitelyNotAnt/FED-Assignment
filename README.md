## Features

 It has an introduction page to introduce users to the website and direct them to the website's main features.
 It has a statistics page that have two options, which are local and global. Both pages have a Covid-19 heatmap, and headlines. The differences in these two are 
 1. Global allows users to see statistics from different countries and global headlines.
 2. Local detect the country the user is from and displays local statistics along with local headlines and also resource centers in that country.
 It has an about page to provide detaied information about various topics, like Faq and About Us.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
