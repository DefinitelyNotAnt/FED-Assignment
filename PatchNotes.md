# Patch Notes

## Navbar changes
### Slight changes to coloring
- Opacity fix for nav links to make it more visible
Notes: Dropdown reduced opacity was not intended but it looks better so it'll remain that way

### Slide in from top animation
- Animation to slide navbar from top
- Currently set to ease-out 1s
- Only position change
Notes: Might tinker with opacity and maybe have the links do a separate timing

## Cursor update
- Hides regular cursor for now
- Now has a "?" icon when hovering search elements
Notes: Might add another more solid cursor without the delay for more seamless work
> [!NOTE]
> Currently a temp design while thinking over how the actual design would work.
> Current design is not practical due to trailer not being where the pointer actually is while moving.
> Plan is to add another trailer that does not have a delay.

# Overall changes
Some coloring and placeholder titles, subheading, cursor effects, and a navbar slide in animation.
