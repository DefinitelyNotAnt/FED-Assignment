# Patch Notes

## Framework
### Added sketch for Home Page design
- PC View
- Mobile View

## Assets
### Added a Lottie Animation for Logo
- [Logo](assets/logo.json)
Notes: Used for temporary logo (?) and maybe future micro-animations.
Will add another for loading.

## Added Navbars
### Added navbars to Home and About Pages
- Font Color is temporary
- Search bar is decorative for now
- Donations section not available for now
- Only the Home and About links work
Notes: Change font color for links, and some opacity differences.

### Navbar fit for mobile
- Navbar collapses for mobile
- Can be opened and collapsed for mobile into a column format
Notes: Making collapsable icon scalable is To Be Decided. KIV scaling and color.

## Mouse cursor
### Removed old trailer
- Old one was too chunky and felt a little off
- Does not match the theme
- some formatting issues in conflict with grid
Notes: DO NOT REVERT. Old trailer will cause grid formatting to fail.

### Added new trailer
- Simple transparent circle with white outline.
- Expands when hovering over interactables
Notes: Remove for mobile view
Adjust scaling to match severity of link
(Eg. Jump to top expands a little, Go to new page expands more)
Color fills and has an icon representing interactable type
(Eg. Link has an arrow, Videos have a play icon)

# Overall changes
Mouse trailer revamp, Added navbar, some styling fixes and added a lottie animation as logo.
